# AIOps Self-Healing Microservices Platform

Academic capstone project. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full permanent project
rules and weekly roadmap.

## Status

Week 6 complete: `dataset-tools/` (Python) turns Week 5's raw telemetry
into a 68-incident labeled dataset (16 real, 52 deterministic synthetic —
both clearly labeled, never conflated), splits it deterministically
(seed 42, stratified by fault type) into a 20-incident Memory set and a
48-incident Evaluation set, and builds a local, persistent ChromaDB
collection from the Memory set only. The Evaluation/Memory separation is
enforced in code (ChromaDB's indexing path never opens the Evaluation
file, and independently double-checks for ID overlap before and after
indexing), not just by convention. See `dataset-tools/README.md` for the
full architecture, schema, and how to reproduce it.

Week 5 complete: an automated telemetry collector (`telemetry/`, Python)
continuously captures health, curated Prometheus metrics, fault state, and
synthetic end-to-end payment attempts from all four services into
structured JSONL files, and can orchestrate a full NORMAL → FAULT →
RECOVERY experiment against any of the four controlled faults. See
`telemetry/README.md` for the full design, schema, and how to run it.

Week 4 complete: all four services expose Spring Boot Actuator + Prometheus
metrics, Prometheus itself runs in-cluster scraping all four, Kubernetes
readiness/liveness probes are live on all four app Deployments, and all
four controlled faults (auth key error, payment memory leak, ledger DB pool
exhaustion, notification latency) are implemented, disabled by default, and
verified end-to-end (native, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes).

## Prerequisites

**PostgreSQL** (native, via Homebrew) — still used for `ledger-service`'s
local `mvn test` run outside of Docker/Kubernetes:

```bash
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16
```

One-time setup of the app role and databases:

```bash
PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin:$PATH"
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE ROLE aiops WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'aiops-dev-password' CREATEDB;"
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ledger_db OWNER aiops;"
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE ledger_db_test OWNER aiops;"  # used by ledger-service's test suite
```

**Docker** — via [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) (not Docker
Desktop, to keep everything CLI-driven with no GUI/license click-through):

```bash
brew install colima docker docker-compose docker-buildx kubectl minikube
colima start --cpu 4 --memory 6 --disk 20
```

`docker compose`/`docker buildx` need Homebrew's plugin directory registered once in `~/.docker/config.json`:

```json
{ "cliPluginsExtraDirs": ["/opt/homebrew/lib/docker/cli-plugins"] }
```

## Services

### auth-service (port 8081)

Issues and validates JWTs against a hardcoded (in-memory) user store.
This is a placeholder user store, intentionally kept simple for Week 1;
it will be replaced with a persisted store in a later week.

Seeded users:

| username | password |
|---|---|
| alice | alice-pass |
| bob | bob-pass |

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/login` — `{"username": "...", "password": "..."}` → `{"token": "...", "tokenType": "Bearer", "expiresInMs": ...}`
- `POST /api/auth/validate` — `{"token": "..."}` → `{"valid": bool, "username": "...", "roles": [...], "error": "..."}`

Configuration (env vars): `SERVER_PORT` (8081), `JWT_SECRET` (dev-only default — override outside local dev), `JWT_EXPIRATION_MS` (3600000).

**Fault injection** (disabled by default — see "Fault injection" below): `POST /inject-auth-key-error`, `POST /reset-auth-key`, `GET /fault-status` (read-only, added Week 5 for the telemetry collector).

### ledger-service (port 8083)

Manages accounts and performs debit/credit operations against PostgreSQL
inside real `@Transactional` boundaries (with pessimistic row locking, so
concurrent operations on the same account serialize correctly).

Seeds one demo account, `acct-42`, with a balance of 1000.00 USD on
startup (disable via `SEED_DEMO_ACCOUNT=false`) — a placeholder in the same
spirit as auth-service's hardcoded user store, since there's no account
provisioning flow yet.

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/accounts` — `{"accountId", "currency", "initialBalance"}` → `201` `{"accountId", "currency", "balance"}`
- `GET /api/accounts/{accountId}` → `{"accountId", "currency", "balance"}` or `404`
- `POST /api/ledger/debit` — `{"accountId", "currency", "amount"}` → `200` transaction record, `404` unknown account, `409` insufficient funds
- `POST /api/ledger/credit` — same shape, adds instead of subtracting

Configuration (env vars): `SERVER_PORT` (8083), `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` (10 — matches the Week 4 HikariCP fault-injection spec), `SEED_DEMO_ACCOUNT`.

**Fault injection** (disabled by default): `POST /inject-db-lock`, `POST /reset-db-lock`, `GET /fault-status` — holds up to `DB_LOCK_CONNECTIONS_TO_HOLD` (default 9, always clamped below the pool max) raw connections from the pool.

### notification-service (port 8084)

Simulates sending a payment receipt — logs the activity and returns a
`SENT` status. No real email/SMS integration, no persistence.

Endpoint:

- `POST /api/notifications/receipt` — `{"accountId", "currency", "amount", "transactionId", "recipientUsername"}` → `{"notificationId", "status", "sentAt"}`

Configuration (env vars): `SERVER_PORT` (8084).

**Fault injection** (disabled by default): `POST /inject-latency` (optional body `{"delayMs": N}`, default `NOTIFICATION_LATENCY_DEFAULT_DELAY_MS`=6000), `POST /reset-latency`, `GET /fault-status`.

### payment-service (port 8082)

Orchestrates the full synchronous chain: validates the caller's JWT with
auth-service, debits the account via ledger-service, then sends a receipt
via notification-service.

A notification failure is **not** treated as a payment failure — the money
has already moved by that point, so it's logged and reported back as
`notificationStatus: "FAILED"` rather than rolling back or erroring the
whole request. This asymmetry (Payment Service can be slowed/blocked by a
downstream Notification problem without the transaction itself failing) is
intentional groundwork for the Week 4+ fault-injection scenario where a
Notification-service root cause manifests as a Payment-service symptom.

Endpoint:

- `POST /api/payments` — header `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, body `{"accountId", "currency", "amount"}` → `{"status", "message", "authenticatedUser", "ledgerTransactionId", "notificationStatus"}`

Configuration (env vars): `SERVER_PORT` (8082), `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`, `LEDGER_SERVICE_URL`, `NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL` (+ matching `*_TIMEOUT_MS` for each, default 5000).

**Fault injection** (disabled by default): `POST /inject-memory-leak`, `POST /reset-memory-leak`, `GET /fault-status` — retains `MEMORY_LEAK_CHUNK_SIZE_BYTES` (default 5MB) chunks every `MEMORY_LEAK_INTERVAL_MS` (default 1s), hard-capped at `MEMORY_LEAK_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` (default 200MB).

### Observability (Actuator + Prometheus)

All four services expose Spring Boot Actuator: `/actuator/health`,
`/actuator/health/liveness`, `/actuator/health/readiness`,
`/actuator/info`, `/actuator/metrics`, `/actuator/prometheus`.
`management.endpoint.health.show-details: always` — fine for this
local/academic project, not multi-tenant production. Kubernetes
readiness/liveness probes on all four app Deployments use the
`/liveness`/`/readiness` sub-paths (15s/30s initial delay, tuned from
observed real startup times — no restart loops seen in testing).

A Prometheus instance runs inside the cluster (`k8s/prometheus-config.yaml`,
`k8s/prometheus.yaml`) scraping all four services' `/actuator/prometheus`.
It's ClusterIP-only, never exposed outside the cluster — reach it via:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090
```

Then `http://localhost:9090/targets` should show all four jobs `up`.

### Fault injection

Four controlled faults exist, one per service, matching CLAUDE.md's "Fault
injection" section. **All are disabled by default, safe, and resettable.**
Each has an `/inject-*` and matching `/reset-*` endpoint (see each
service's section above for exact endpoints/config). A quick end-to-end
demo of any fault:

```bash
# Auth key error
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/inject-auth-key-error
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/validate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token":"<a token from before the fault>"}'  # now invalid
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/reset-auth-key

# Memory leak (watch it rise)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/inject-memory-leak
curl http://localhost:8082/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.used
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/reset-memory-leak

# DB pool exhaustion
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/inject-db-lock
curl http://localhost:8083/actuator/prometheus | grep hikaricp_connections
curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/reset-db-lock

# Notification latency (payment will time out around 5s, ledger still commits)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/inject-latency
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/payments -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"accountId":"acct-42","currency":"USD","amount":1.00}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/reset-latency
```

The notification-latency fault needs no extra timeout config on the
Payment side — `app.notification-service.timeout-ms` (5000ms, from Week 2)
is already shorter than the fault's default 6000ms delay.

### Correlation IDs

All four services read `X-Correlation-Id` from the incoming request
(generating a UUID if absent), attach it to all log lines via SLF4J MDC,
return it on the response, and propagate it to every downstream call
(payment-service → auth-service / ledger-service / notification-service).
Verified end-to-end: the same correlation ID appears in all four services'
logs for a single payment request. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full convention.

## Running locally

Each service is an independent Maven project. Start PostgreSQL first (see
Prerequisites), then in four terminals:

```bash
cd auth-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd ledger-service && DB_PASSWORD=aiops-dev-password mvn spring-boot:run
cd notification-service && mvn spring-boot:run
cd payment-service && mvn spring-boot:run
```

Try the full chain:

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice","password":"alice-pass"}' | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['token'])")

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"accountId":"acct-42","currency":"USD","amount":150.25}'

curl http://localhost:8083/api/accounts/acct-42   # confirm the balance moved
```

## Running with Docker Compose

Builds and runs all four services plus a PostgreSQL container, fully wired
together on one Docker network:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Same endpoints as native (`localhost:8081`/`8082`/`8083`/`8084`). The
compose Postgres is exposed on host port **5433** (not 5432) so it doesn't
collide with the native Homebrew Postgres from the Prerequisites section —
containers still reach it internally via `postgres:5432`. `JWT_SECRET` and
`DB_PASSWORD` can be overridden via a `.env` file; they default to the same
dev-only placeholder values used elsewhere in this repo.

```bash
docker compose down          # stop and remove containers (keeps the postgres-data volume)
docker compose logs -f       # follow all services' logs
```

## Running on Kubernetes (Minikube)

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker --cpus=2 --memory=3500mb
```

Build the images and load them into Minikube's internal image store (it
doesn't share the host/Colima Docker daemon):

```bash
docker compose build
for svc in auth-service ledger-service notification-service payment-service; do
  docker tag capstone_2026-$svc:latest aiops/$svc:0.1.0
done
```

**Important**: `minikube image load` can silently keep a stale image under
an already-existing tag — confirmed by comparing `docker inspect
aiops/<svc>:0.1.0 --format '{{.Id}}'` between the host daemon and `minikube
ssh -- docker inspect ...`. After the very first load this doesn't matter,
but on every *rebuild*, force-remove the old tag from Minikube's daemon
first, or the running pods can end up serving old code with no error at
apply time:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment auth-service ledger-service notification-service payment-service --replicas=0
for svc in auth-service ledger-service notification-service payment-service; do
  minikube ssh -- "docker rmi -f aiops/$svc:0.1.0" || true
  minikube image load aiops/$svc:0.1.0
done
kubectl scale deployment auth-service ledger-service notification-service payment-service --replicas=1
```

Create the secret the manifests reference (not committed to git — dev-only
placeholder values, same ones already used elsewhere in this repo):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic aiops-secrets \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret='dev-only-insecure-secret-key-change-me-1234567890' \
  --from-literal=db-password='aiops-dev-password'
```

Deploy everything and check status:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl get pods
```

`ledger-service` may restart once or twice on first boot if it starts
before postgres's readiness probe passes — Kubernetes' default restart
policy handles this without an explicit init-container wait, and it
settles once postgres is ready.

Reach the services from your host (each in its own terminal, or backgrounded):

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/auth-service 8081:8081
kubectl port-forward svc/ledger-service 8083:8083
kubectl port-forward svc/notification-service 8084:8084
kubectl port-forward svc/payment-service 8082:8082
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090
```

Then the same curl flow as above works against `localhost`. Postgres in
this setup uses a `PersistentVolumeClaim`, and all four app Deployments/
Services use the exact same env-var contract (`AUTH_SERVICE_URL`, `DB_URL`,
etc.) as native and Compose — just pointed at Kubernetes Service DNS names
instead of `localhost`/compose service names.

Tear down: `kubectl delete -f k8s/` (the PVC and its data persist unless
you also `kubectl delete pvc postgres-pvc`). `minikube stop` pauses the
cluster; `minikube delete` removes it entirely.

## Telemetry collection (Week 5)

A standalone Python collector (`telemetry/`) continuously captures health,
curated Prometheus metrics, fault state, and synthetic payment attempts
from all four services into JSONL files, and can run a full NORMAL →
FAULT → RECOVERY experiment against any of the four faults. It works
unmodified against native, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes (via
`kubectl port-forward` + env vars). Full details, data schema, and
commands: see [`telemetry/README.md`](telemetry/README.md).

```bash
cd telemetry
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m telemetry.experiment notification-latency --baseline-seconds 30 --fault-seconds 30 --recovery-seconds 30
```

## Dataset construction and ChromaDB retrieval memory (Week 6)

`dataset-tools/` builds the incident dataset used for RAG-based root-cause retrieval, from Week
5's raw telemetry. Full details: [`dataset-tools/README.md`](dataset-tools/README.md).

```bash
cd dataset-tools
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .

python -m dataset_tools.build_dataset   # reconstruct real + generate synthetic incidents, split
python -m dataset_tools.chroma_store    # build the ChromaDB collection (Memory set only)
python -m dataset_tools.chroma_store query "payment service returning errors after auth failure"
```

## Testing

```bash
cd auth-service && mvn test
cd ledger-service && mvn test          # needs Postgres running; uses the ledger_db_test database
cd notification-service && mvn test
cd payment-service && mvn test
```

`payment-service`'s tests use OkHttp MockWebServer to stand in for all
three downstream services, so they don't require any other service to be
running. `ledger-service`'s tests run against a real PostgreSQL database
(`ledger_db_test`), each wrapped in a rolled-back transaction so the schema
stays clean between runs.

```bash
cd telemetry && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

The telemetry collector's tests (19) mock all HTTP calls (via `responses`)
and don't require any service to be running.

```bash
cd dataset-tools && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

`dataset-tools`' tests (42) use a real local ChromaDB `PersistentClient`
against an isolated `tmp_path` per test - nothing is mocked - and don't
require any of the four microservices to be running.
